# Aptitude Notes

* Mixture and Alligation
  * Rule of Alligation:
    * C.P of /kg of cheaper(c) $~~~~~~~~~~$ C.P of /kg of dearer(d)
    * $~~~~~~~~~~$ Mean price(m) $~~~~~~~~~~$
    * d-m $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ m-c
    
    *   cheaper_quantity/ dearer_quantity = (d-m)/(m-c)

    * Calulate mean CP
      * Gain = (SP-CP)/CP x 100
      * Loss = (CP-SP)/CP X 100


    * Suppose a container contains x of liquid from which y units are taken out and replaced by water.After n operations, the quantity of pure liquid = 
    * $$x (1 - y/x)^n$$ units.

    * A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containing 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 26%. The quantity of whisky replaced is: 
    * $$40(1-x)/100+19x/100 = 26/100$$
  

* Problems on Age
  * let present age of son be x

* Partnership
  * If A and B invest Rs. x and Rs. y respectively for a year in a business, then at the end of the year
    * A's share of profit : B's share of profit = x : y

  * If investments are for different time periods.
    * If A invests Rs. x for p months and B invests Rs. y for q months, then
      * A's share of profit: B's share of profit = xp : yq    
       
    * A's share of profit: B's share of profit: C's share of profit = xp : yq : zr
      * where, x = investment of A, Y = investment of B, Z = investment of C
      * and, p = time of investment of A, q = time of investment of B and r = time of investment of C
