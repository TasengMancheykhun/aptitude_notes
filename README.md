* Mixture and Alligation
  * Rule of Alligation:
    * C.P of /kg of cheaper(c)      $~~~~~~~~~~$       C.P of /kg of dearer(d)
    *        $~~~~~~~~~~$           Mean price(m)      $~~~~~~~~~~$
    * d-m     $~~~~~~~~~~$ m-c
    
    *   cheaper quantity    (d-m)
    *   ---------------- =  -----
    *   dearer quantity     (m-c)
