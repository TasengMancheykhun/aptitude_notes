# Aptitude Notes

* Mixture and Alligation
  * Rule of Alligation:
    * C.P of /kg of cheaper(c) $~~~~~~~~~~$ C.P of /kg of dearer(d)
    * $~~~~~~~~~~$ Mean price(m) $~~~~~~~~~~$
    * d-m $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ m-c
    
    *   cheaper_quantity/ dearer_quantity = (d-m)/(m-c)


    * Suppose a container contains x of liquid from which y units are taken out and replaced by water.After n operations, the quantity of pure liquid = 
    * $$x (1 - y/x)^n$$ units.

    * A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containing 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 26%. The quantity of whisky replaced is: 
    * $$40(1-x)/100+19x/100 = 26/100$$
